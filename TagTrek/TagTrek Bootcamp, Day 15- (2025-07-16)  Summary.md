# TagTrek Bootcamp Day 15 – 2025-07-16

# Summary

Replaced the anki-sync-server with the latest released by the project devs. The earlier version used a deprecated flash card sync approach.  I learned how to fix the port on container and set environment variables for the Anki user name and password.

It's getting harder to link everything together in the Obsidian vault, so I've compromised on the use of folders to help organized my notes.  That led to more research and discussion with ChatGPT about the [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/) system.  I came up with a way to organize the project that mostly aligns with the way the Johnny Decimal system breaks down areas and categories.  While I will have the typical 10 areas, each with 10 categories, the number of items in a category won't be limited to 100.  It will be unbounded because I want to really decompose my technical notes.

Worked with ChatGPT to generate Anki flashcards for my finished notes.  The whole flashcard sync process is smooth.
