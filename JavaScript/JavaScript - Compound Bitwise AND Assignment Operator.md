# JavaScript - Compound Bitwise AND Assignment Operator

## Overview
The `&=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:
- The [[JavaScript - Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[JavaScript - Bitwise AND Operator]])

- It applies the `bitwise and` operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand value, and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax
```javascript
x &= y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x & y;
