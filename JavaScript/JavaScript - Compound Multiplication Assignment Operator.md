# JavaScript - Compound Multiplication Assignment Operator

## Overview
The `*=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:
- The [[JavaScript - Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[JavaScript - Multiplication Operator]])

- It applies the `multiplication` operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand value, and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax
```javascript

x *= y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x * y;
