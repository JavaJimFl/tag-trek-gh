# JavaScript - Compound Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Operator

## Overview
The `>>>=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:
- The [[JavaScript - Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[JavaScript - Unsigned Right Shift Operator]])

- It applies the `unsigned right shift` operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand value, and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax
```javascript
x >>>= y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x >>> y;
