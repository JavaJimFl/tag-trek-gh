# JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
## Overview
- Arithmetic operators perform numeric calculations on values (literals, variables, or expressions).
- Operators follow a specific **precedence order** when evaluated in expressions.
- For a complete precedence chart, see: [[JavaScript - Operator Precedence#Arithmetic Operators]]

## Arithmetic Operators by Precedence
### 1. Exponentations
- (13) Exponentiation: `x ** y` â†’ [[JavaScript - Exponentiation Operator]]
--- 
### 2. Multiplications and divisions
- (12) Multiplication: `x * y` â†’ [[JavaScript - Multiplication Operator]]
- (12) Division: `x / y` â†’ [[JavaScript - Division Operator]]
- (12) Modulus (remainder): `x % y` [[JavaScript - Modulus Operator]]
--- 
### 3. Additions and subtractions
- (11) Addition: `x + y` â†’ [[JavaScript - Addition Operator]]
- (11) Subtraction: `x - y` â†’ [[JavaScript - Subtraction Operator]]

### 4. Increment and Decrement (special case)
- `++` Increment â†’ [[JavaScript - Increment Operator]]
- `--` Decrement â†’ [[JavaScript - Decrement Operator]]

> ğŸ’¡ *Note: Increment and decrement have higher precedence than addition/subtraction but are often listed separately due to their unary nature and prefix/postfix variations.*
