# JavaScript - Compound Division Assignment Operator

## Overview
The `/=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:
- The [[JavaScript - Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[JavaScript - Division Operator]])

- It applies the `division` operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand value, and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax
```javascript
x /= y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x / y;
