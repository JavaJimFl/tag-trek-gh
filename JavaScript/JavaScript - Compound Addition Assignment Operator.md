# JavaScript Compound Addition Assignment Operator
## Overview
The `+=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:
- The [[JavaScript - Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[JavaScript - Addition Operator]] (`+`)
- It adds the right-hand value to the left-hand variable and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax
```javascript

x += y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x + y;
```
## Example
```javascript

let score = 10;
score += 5;  // score in now 15
```
