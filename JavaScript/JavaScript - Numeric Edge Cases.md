# JavaScript - Numeric Edge Cases

## Overview
JavaScript includes three **special numeric values** that behave differently than typical numbers:

### [[JavaScript - NaN]]
- Result of invalid numeric operations
- Type is still `"number"`

### [[JavaScript - Infinity]]
- Result of division by zero or overflow
- Represents positive infinity

### [[JavaScript - Negative Infinity]]
- Similar to `Infinity`, but in the negative direction
