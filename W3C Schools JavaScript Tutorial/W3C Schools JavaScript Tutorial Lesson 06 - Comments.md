# ðŸ’¬ JavaScript Comments
- Explain code
- Improve readability
- Temporarily disable code (for testing)

---

### ðŸŸ© Single-Line Comments
- Start with `//`
- JS ignores from `//` to end of line
- Used:
    - Above code line (describe action)
    - At end of code line (explain purpose)

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Multi-Line (Block) Comments
- Start with `/*`, end with `*/`
- JS ignores everything between
- Used:
    - For documentation
    - To explain multiple lines

---

### ðŸš« Comments for Disabling Code
- Use `//` to prevent execution
- Helpful in testing/debugging

---

### ðŸ“Œ Best Practices
- Prefer single-line for quick notes
- Use block comments for longer explanations
- Avoid leaving disabled code in production
