# JavaScript Numeric Edge Cases

## Overview
JavaScript includes three **special numeric values** that behave differently than typical numbers:

### [[61.226 - JavaScript NaN]]
- Result of invalid numeric operations
- Type is still `"number"`

### [[61.222 - JavaScript Infinity]]
- Result of division by zero or overflow
- Represents positive infinity

### [[61.224 - JavaScript Negative Infinity]]
- Similar to `Infinity`, but in the negative direction
