# JavaScript String Quotes

## Overview
- Strings in JavaScript can be defined using **single (`'`)** or **double (`"`)** quotes.
- The two styles are functionally equivalent.
- You can include one type of quote inside the other without escaping.
```javascript
let a = "It's fine";
let b = 'He said "Hello"';
```
