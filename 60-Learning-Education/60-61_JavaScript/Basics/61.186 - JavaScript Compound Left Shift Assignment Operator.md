# JavaScript Compound Left Shift Assignment Operator

## Overview
The `<<=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:
- The [[61.170 - JavaScript Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[JavaScript - Left Shift Operator]])

- It applies the `left shift` operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand value, and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax
```javascript
x <<= y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x << y;
