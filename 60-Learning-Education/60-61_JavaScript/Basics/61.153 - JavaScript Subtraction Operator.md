# Subtraction Operator
## Overview
- The subtraction operator (`-`) subtracts one numeric value from another.
- Unlike (`+`), it only works with numbers
- JavaScript will try to convert a non-number to a number
## Example
```javascript

// Numeric subtraction
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x - y; //3

// Subtraction with type coercion
let a = "10";
let b = 4;
let difference = a - b; // 6 ("10" is coerced to number)
```
