# JavaScript Compound Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator

## Overview
The `^=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:
- The [[61.170 - JavaScript Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[61.192 - JavaScript Bitwise Operators#^xor|61.192 - JavaScript Bitwise Operators]]) (`^`)

- It applies the `bitwise xor` operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand value, and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax
```javascript
x ^= y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x ^ y;
