# JavaScript - Escape Sequences

## Overview
- Inner nested quotes of the same type (`'`, `"`)  must be escaped
- Otherwise, JavaScript will terminate the string incorrectly.
- Use the **Backslash character (`\`)**  to escape quotes and special characters.
- Escape sequences are also used to represent:
    - Invisible characters
    - Control characters

## Examples
```javascript
// Escapes a double quote within a double-quoted string
let text1 = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";

// Escapes a single quote within a single-quoted string
let text2 = 'It\'s alright.';

// Escapes a backslash in a string
let text3 = "The character \\ is called backslash.";
```

## Notes
- These are the valid JavaScript escape sequences.  Most have no use in HTML, but they do in non-HTML contexts:

| code | result               | description         | Useful for HTML? |
| ---- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| `\'` | `'`                  | Single quote        | ✅               |
| `\"` | `"`                  | Double quote        | ✅               |
| `\\` | `\`                  | Backslash           | ✅               |
| `\b` | Backspace            | Invisible character | ❌               |
| `\f  | Form Feed            | Control character   | ❌               |
| `\n` | New Line             | Invisible character | ❌ (use <br>)    |
| `\r` | Carriage Return      | Control character   | ❌               |
| `\t` | Horizontal Tabulator | Invisible character | ❌               |
| `\v` | Vertical Tabulator   | Invisible character | ❌               |

⚠️ In HTML, use entities like `&quot;`, `&lt;`, and `<br>` instead of escape sequences.
