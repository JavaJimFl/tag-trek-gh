# JavaScript Compound Addition Assignment Operator

## Overview

The `+=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:

- The [[61.170 - JavaScript Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[61.151 - JavaScript Addition Operator]] (`+`)
- It adds the right-hand value to the left-hand variable and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax

```javascript
x += y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x + y;
```

## Example

```javascript
let score = 10;
score += 5; // score in now 15
```
