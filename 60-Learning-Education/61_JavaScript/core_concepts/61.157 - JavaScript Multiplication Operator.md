# Multiplication Operator

## Overview

- The Multiplication operator (`*`) subtracts one numeric value from another.
- JavaScript will try to convert a non-number to a number

## Example

```javascript
// Numeric Multiplication
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y; // 10

// Multiplication with type coercion
let a = "6";
let b = 2;
let product = a * b; // 12 ("6" is coerced to number)
```
