# JavaScript Compound Right Shift Assignment Operator

## Overview

The `>>=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:

- The [[61.170 - JavaScript Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[JavaScript - Right Shift Operator]])

- It applies the `right shift` operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand value, and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax

```javascript
x >>= y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x >> y;
```
