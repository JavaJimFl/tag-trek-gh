# JavaScript Compound Bitwise OR Assignment Operator

## Overview

The `|=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:

- The [[61.170 - JavaScript Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[61.192 - JavaScript Bitwise Operators#^or|61.192 - JavaScript Bitwise Operators]]) (`|`)

- It applies the `bitwise or` operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand value, and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax

```javascript
x |= y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x | y;
```
