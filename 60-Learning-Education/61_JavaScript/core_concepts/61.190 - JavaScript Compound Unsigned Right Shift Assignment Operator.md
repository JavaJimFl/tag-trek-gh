# JavaScript Compound Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Operator

## Overview

The `>>>=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:

- The [[61.170 - JavaScript Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[61.192 - JavaScript Bitwise Operators#uright|61.192 - JavaScript Bitwise Operator]]) (`>>>`)

- It applies the `unsigned right shift` operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand value, and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax

```javascript
x >>>= y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x >>> y;
```
