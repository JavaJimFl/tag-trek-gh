# JavaScript String Properties & Access

## Overview
- JavaScript strings come with built-in properties and methods that allow you to inspect and access their characters.
- Strings behave like immutable character arrays.

## `length`
- The `.length` property returns the **number of UTF-16 code units** in the string.
- It is a **read-only** property and reflects the total number of characters.

## Character Access
JavaScript provides several ways to access individual characters in a string:
- `str.charAt(0)`:
    -  Returns the character at the specified index.
    -  Returns an empty string if out of bounds.
- `str[index]`:
    - Array-like access to characters (introduced in ES5)
    - Also returns `undefined` if out of bounds.
- `str.at(index)`  
    - Introduced in ES2022. 
    - Supports **negative indices** to access characters from the end.

## Immutability
- Strings in JavaScript are **immutable**: their characters cannot be changed directly.
- Attempting to assign to an index (`str[0] = "X"`) has no effect and fails silently.

## Examples
```javascript
const message = "Obsidian";

// Length
console.log(message.length);      // 8

// Character access
console.log(message.charAt(3));   // "i"
console.log(message[3]);          // "i"
console.log(message.at(-1));      // "n"

// Attempt to mutate a string
message[0] = "X";
console.log(message);             // "Obsidian" (unchanged)

```

## Notes
- Use `str.at()` for modern, readable negative indexing.
- Prefer `[]` over `charAt()` for brevityâ€”unless supporting very old browsers.
- Strings are immutable but safely shareable and memory-efficient.
