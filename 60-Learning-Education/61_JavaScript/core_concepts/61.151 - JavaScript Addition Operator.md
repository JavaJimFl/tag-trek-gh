# Addition Operator

## Overview

- The addition operator (`+`) adds numbers or concatenates strings.
- Behavior depends on the operand types
-

## Example

```javascript
// Numeric addition
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;

// String concatenation
let name = "Jim";

// "Hello, Jim"
let greeting = "Hello, " + name;
```

## Flashcards

<!--ANKI START-->

Q: What does the `+` operator do in JavaScript?  
A: It either adds numbers or concatenates strings, depending on the operand types.

---

Q: How does JavaScript determine whether to add numbers or concatenate strings using the `+` operator?  
A: If either operand is a string, JavaScript coerces the other to a string and performs string concatenation. Otherwise, it performs numeric addition.

---

Q: What is the result of the following code?

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;
```

A: `z` is `7` — numeric addition of 5 and 2.

---

Q: What is the value of `greeting` in this code?

```javascript
let name = "Jim";
let greeting = "Hello, " + name;
```

A: `"Hello, Jim"` — the `+` operator concatenates the strings.

---

```javascript
let name = "Jim";
let greeting = {{c1::"Hello, "}} + {{c2::name}}; // → {{c3::"Hello, Jim"}}
```
