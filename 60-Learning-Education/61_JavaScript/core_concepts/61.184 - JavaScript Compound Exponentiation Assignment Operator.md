# JavaScript Compound Exponentiation Assignment Operator

## Overview

The `**=` operator is a **compound assignment operator**. It combines:

- The [[61.170 - JavaScript Basic Assignment Operator]] (`=`)
- The [[61.155 - JavaScript Exponentiation Operator]])

- It applies the `exponentiation` operation between the left-hand variable and the right-hand value, and reassigns the result to the variable.

## Syntax

```javascript
x **= y;

// Is shorthand for
x = x ** y;
```
