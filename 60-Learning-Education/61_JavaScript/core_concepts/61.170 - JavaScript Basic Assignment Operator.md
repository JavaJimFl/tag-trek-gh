# JavaScript Basic Assignment Operator

- `=`: assignment operator (not equality check)
- Assigns right-hand value to left-hand variable

## Syntax

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = x;
```

## Notes

    - The left side must be something assignable:
        - variable
        - object property

- The right side can be any expression, including another assignment

```javascript
let x = 2;
let y = (x = 10); // x becomes 10, y also becomes 10
```
