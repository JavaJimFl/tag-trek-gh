# JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

## Overview

- Arithmetic operators perform numeric calculations on values (literals, variables, or expressions).
- Operators follow a specific **precedence order** when evaluated in expressions.
- For a complete precedence chart, see: [[JavaScript - Operator Precedence#Arithmetic Operators]]

## Operators vs. operands

- Operand = number value
- Operator = action between two operands
- Forms:
  - Literals: `100 + 50`
  - Variables: `x ** y`
  - Nested Expressions: `(100 + 50) * a`

## Arithmetic Operators by Precedence

### 1. Exponentiations

- (13) Exponentiation: `x ** y` â†’ [[61.155 - JavaScript Exponentiation Operator]]

---

### 2. Multiplications and divisions

- (12) Multiplication: `x * y` â†’ [[61.157 - JavaScript Multiplication Operator]]
- (12) Division: `x / y` â†’ [[61.159 - JavaScript Division Operator]]
- (12) Modulus (remainder): `x % y` [[61.161 - JavaScript Modulus Operator]]

---

### 3. Additions and subtractions

- (11) Addition: `x + y` â†’ [[61.151 - JavaScript Addition Operator]]
- (11) Subtraction: `x - y` â†’ [[61.153 - JavaScript Subtraction Operator]]

### 4. Increment and Decrement (special case)

- `++` Increment â†’ [[61.163 - JavaScript Increment Operator]]
- `--` Decrement â†’ [[61.165 - JavaScript Decrement Operator]]

> ğŸ’¡ _Note: Increment and decrement have higher precedence than addition/subtraction but are often listed separately due to their unary nature and prefix/postfix variations._
