START
Basic
Is the `=` operator an equality check in JavaScript?
Back: No. Equality checks use `==` (loose) or `===` (strict); `=` is only for **assignment**.

Basic
After this code executes, what are the values of `x` and `y`?

```javascript
let x = 2;
let y = (x = 10);
```

Back: Both **x = 10** and **y = 10**. The assignment expression `x = 10` returns `10`, which is then assigned to `y`.
