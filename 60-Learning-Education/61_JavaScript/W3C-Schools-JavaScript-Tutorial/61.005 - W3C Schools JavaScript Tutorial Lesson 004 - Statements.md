# Statements

### JavaScript Programs

- Program = list of instructions
- Instructions = _statements_
- Browser executes JavaScript in HTML

---

### JavaScript Statements

- Built from
  - values
  - operators
  - expressions
  - keywords
  - comments
- Executed top to bottom, in order
- Often called “JavaScript code”
- Multiple per line separated semicolons
  - `let a, b, c;` (1 statement)
  - `let a; let b; let c;` ( 3 statements)

---

### Examples

- Declare
  - `let x, y, z;` // No assignment
- Declare and Assign
  - `x = 5;` (Global scope if not prev declared)
  - `var y = 6;` (function scoped)
  - `let name = "bob";` (block-scoped variable)
  - `const a = 6;`(block-scoped constant)
- Compute
  - `z = x + y;`

---

### Semicolons `;`

- Separate statements
- Recommended, not required
- Multiple statements per line allowed
  - `a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;`

---

### White Space

- Multiple spaces ignored
- Improves readability
- Best practice: add space around operators
- `let x = y + z;`

---

### Line Length & Breaks

- Avoid lines > 80 characters
- Break lines after operators

---

### Code Blocks `{...}`

- Group statements
- Used in functions, conditionals, loops

---

### Keywords (Reserved Words)

- Start most statements
- Can’t be used as variable names

#### Common Keywords

- `var` – declare variable (function-scoped)
- `let` – declare block-scoped variable
- `const` – declare block-scoped constant
- `if` – conditional block
- `switch` – multi-case block
- `for` – loop
- `function` – define function
- `return` – exit function
- `try` – error handling block
